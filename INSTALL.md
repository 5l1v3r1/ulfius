# Install Ulfius

## Prerequisites

### External dependencies

To install the external dependencies, for Debian based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian, etc.), run as root:

```shell
# apt-get install libmicrohttpd-dev libjansson-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev
```

### Note

Here libcurl4-gnutls-dev for the example, but any `libcurl*-dev` library should be sufficent, depending on your needs and configuration.

Also, it seems that Debian Wheezy uses an old version of libjansson (2.3), you can either upgrade to jessie or download the latest version of libjansson from [github](https://github.com/akheron/jansson).

## Installation

Download Ulfius source code from Github, get the submodules, compile and install:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/babelouest/ulfius.git
$ cd ulfius/
$ git submodule update --init
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

By default, the shared libraries and the header files will be installed in the `/usr/local` location. To change this setting, you can modify the `PREFIX` value in the `src/Makefile`, `lib/orcania/Makefile` and `lib/yder/src/Makefile` files.

If you download Ulfius as a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file via github release tab, you must initiaize the submodules prior to the compilaton with the following command:

```shell
$ cd ulfius/
$ git submodule update --init
```

### libcurl older than 7.20

If you use old version of liburl, as in Centos 6.5 for example, `ulfius_send_smtp_email` won't be available due to libcurl options problems. In this case, uncomment the following line in the file `src/Makefile`:

```Makefile
#SMTPFLAGS=-DULFIUS_IGNORE_SMTP
```

This will disable `ulfius_send_smtp_email` during the compilation.
